# LorrowLogger
LorrowLogger (<ins>L</ins>end B<ins>orrow</ins> <ins>Logger</ins>) is an Android application which 
allows users to log their financial transactions with their friends, family, colleagues 
or any other acquaintances. It makes it easier for the users to keep a tab on their 
transactions with people, whether they lend/give money to or borrow/take money 
from anyone. LorrowLogger supports users to log transactions with multiple 
people and displays the total amount of money which is to be taken or given to the 
person with whom the transactions are occurring. LorrowLogger is very beneficial 
for students as they lend/borrow money a lot from each other the entire day and are 
confused with the actual amount at the end of the day while settling accounts. 
LorrowLogger comes in handy in such situations, it sums up all the transactions 
and gives you the exact amount of money you need to give/take to settle accounts. 
Apart from students, almost everyone can use LorrowLogger as almost everyone 
today is indulged into lending and borrowing money. It offers a simple, easy to 
understand interface. We hope it makes your life easier.

## Goals and objectives
The main goal of the application is to provide a simple, easy to use interface 
to the user which allows them to create/delete accounts with multiple people. 
Every person in the list should have a separate account. Each account with a person 
should be able to log the transactions taking place, be it lending or borrowing 
money. Along with it, it should also be able to display the total amount of money 
to be given/taken to settle the account with that person.
## Development Stack
LorrowLogger supports only on Android devices with API SDK(Android 
version) Android API 21 i.e Android 5 (Lollipop) or higher. The target SDK (i.e 
the version for which the developers are actually developing their application) is 
Android API 32 i.e Android 12 (SnowCone). LorrowLogger is developed using 
Android Studio Chipmunk. It is developed mainly using XML for front-end 
and Java for back-end.
